Machine Learning For Sustainable Chemistry
Overview

The Machine_Learning_For_Sustainable_Chemistry project focuses on leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to support sustainable chemistry practices. This repository is structured to facilitate data gathering, analysis, and user interaction, with an emphasis on solvent data to drive sustainability in chemical processes.
Repository Structure:

    data_analysis/:
        Purpose: This directory contains notebooks and scripts for analyzing solvent data.
        Content: Provides detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualizations. The analyses aim to derive insights into solvent properties, supporting sustainable chemical decision-making.

    data_gathering/:
        Purpose: Handles the collection and preprocessing of solvent-related data.
        Content: Scripts and notebooks designed to gather raw data, clean it, and prepare it for use in machine learning models or further analysis. Ensures that only high-quality data is fed into subsequent stages.

    datasets_used/:
        Purpose: Stores all datasets used in the project.
        Content: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets, as well as descriptions and metadata for each data source. It serves as a reference for data inputs in the machine learning models and analysis.

    user_interface/:
        Purpose: Provides an interactive interface for users to engage with the tool.
        Content: Code for the user interface that allows users to input solvent data and receive calculated results based on machine learning models. This ensures that the tool is accessible and easy to use for chemists and researchers interested in sustainability.
